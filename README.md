#### this was a practice project that I've done for the first time ever , the whole purpose of the course was learning the HTML and CSS abd the JS part was copy according to the instructor due to lack of JS tutorial

## features that have implemented in this project: 
- Responsive design for three main major viewport including mobile phones , tablets and desktop
- transition and FlexBox and CSS grid layout
- Icons from ionicon
#####  this was the first project that i’ve ever done and i did it along with learning from jonas schmedtmann that has a full course which was +40Hours an that point i wasn’t familiar with git and github so i just i wanted to learn HTML and CSS and RWD // the reason that i’m uploading this project up to github is remembering where i was and see how i improved my skills and sometimes i return to this project and see how simple i structured my files and how messy things were in the first project
